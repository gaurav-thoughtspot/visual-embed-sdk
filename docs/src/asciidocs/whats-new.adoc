== August 2021


=== Custom actions

The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud August release introduces the following features:

[width="100%" cols="1,4"]
|====
||
|[tag greenBackground]#New feature# a| *Custom actions for worksheets*

The worksheet pages now include a `Custom actions` tab that shows the custom actions created in the Developer portal. ThoughtSpot users can add these  actions to a worksheet and place them as primary actions or menu items in the new visualizations built from that worksheet.

This feature is available to all ThoughtSpot users with edit privileges to modify a worksheet.

For more information, see xref:custom-actions-worksheet.adoc[Add custom actions to a worksheet].

|[tag greenBackground]#New feature# a|**Query parameters for URL-based custom actions**

The Developer portal now allows you to add arbitrary key-value pairs as query parameters for a URL action. If a URL endpoint requires specific information, such as the database details or data object attributes, you can add a key-value pair of these attributes when creating a custom action. When the custom action workflow is triggered, these attributes are passed as query parameters in `GET` requests to get the data payload from ThoughtSpot.

For more information, see xref:custom-actions-url.adoc[Configure a custom URL action].
|====

=== Visual Embed SDK

The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud August release supports Visual Embed SDK version 1.3.1, which includes the following features and enhancements.

[width="100%" cols="1,4"]
|====
||
| [tag greenBackground]#New feature#  a| *searchOptions*

The `searchEmbed` SDK package introduces the `searchOptions` parameter for setting search tokens. The `searchOptions` parameter includes the following attributes:

* `searchTokenString`
+
A TML query string to define search tokens.

* `executeSearch`
+
When set to `true`, it executes search and shows the search results.

For more information, see xref:embed-search.adoc#search-query[Embed ThoughtSpot search].

| [tag redBackground]#Deprecated# a|**searchQuery**

The `searchQuery` parameter in the `searchEmbed` SDK package is deprecated in the Visual Embed SDK version 1.3.1. Instead, you can use the `searchOptions` parameter to define the search token string.

For more information about `searchOptions`, see xref:embed-search.adoc#search-query[Embed ThoughtSpot search].

|[tag greenBackground]#New feature# a|**autoLogin**

The SDK now supports logging in users automatically after a user session has expired.

For more information, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc##embed-session-sec[Embed user authentication]. 

|[tag greenBackground]##New feature## a|**shouldEncodeUrlQueryParams**

You can now convert query parameters in the ThoughtSpot generated URLs to base64-encoded format. You can enable this attribute to secure your cluster from cross-site scripting attacks.
|[tag redBackground]#Breaking change# a|**Data structure modifications in custom action response payload**

* The  data structure passed in the custom action response for search now shows as `payload.data.embedAnswerData` instead of `payload.data.columnsAndData`.

* The answer payload for custom actions includes the following metadata:

** `reportBookmetadata`
+
Includes visualization metadata attributes such as description, object header metadata, author details, timestamp of the answer creation, and modification.

** user data
+
Includes user information such as username, GUID of the user, and email address.

To view a sample response payload, see xref:callback-response-payload.adoc#search-data-payload[Custom action response payload].

|[tag greenBackground]#New feature# a|**preventPinboardFilterRemoval**

The `pinboardEmbed` SDK package now includes the `preventPinboardFilterRemoval` attribute. You can use this attribute to disable filter-specific actions, such as editing or removing a filter applied to a visualization.

For more information, see xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[Embed a pinboard] and xref:embed-a-viz.adoc[Embed a visualization].
|[tag greenBackground]#New feature# a|**suppressNoCookieAccessAlert**

You can now set custom alerts for `noCookieAccess` events. By default, the SDK triggers a `noCookieAcess` event and generates an alert when a user's browser blocks third-party cookies. The `suppressNoCookieAccessAlert` allows you to disable this alert. 

|[tag greenBackground]#New feature# a|**Support for fetching callback custom action payload in batches**

The Visual Embed SDK supports processing data in batches for callback custom action responses.
The callback custom action event in the SDK package supports defining `batchSize` and `offset` values to paginate the answer payload and send the records in batches.

For more information, see xref:push-data-to-external-app.adoc#large-dataset[Callback custom action workflow].
|====

=== REST APIs

The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud August release introduces several new APIs to xref:user-api.adoc[manage users], xref:group-api.adoc[user groups], xref:admin-api.adoc[cluster configuration], xref:dependent-apis.adoc[object dependencies], and so on.

For a complete list of APIs, see xref:rest-api-reference.adoc[REST API Reference].

== June 2021

The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud June release introduces the following features and enhancements:

=== Global and local custom actions

The ThoughtSpot developer portal now supports configuring a custom action as a __global__ or __local__ action. This feature allows you to determine and control the placement of custom actions in the ThoughtSpot UI. Developers can now choose to create a custom action that will appear on all visualizations, or a specific custom action that can be added to a visualization by a ThoughtSpot user. The custom actions panel in the visualization page allows ThoughtSpot users to view the available custom actions and add an action to any visualization.

For example, if you want an action that triggers a callback into your parent app, which would then post its data to Slack, you might want to add a custom action globally to all visualizations. Similarly, if you want to send the data obtained from a specific visualization to a URL, you can associate a custom action locally to that visualization.

For more information, see xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[Custom actions] and xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Add a custom action to a specific visualization].

=== Authentication schemes for custom actions

You can now apply an authentication scheme for a custom action that triggers a data payload to a specific URL target. If an action requires your users to authenticate to send  data to a URL, you can specify the authentication method and authorization attributes when creating a custom action in the Developer portal.
ThoughtSpot will use this information to send the required attributes in the `Authorization` headers to the URL endpoint configured in the custom action.

=== Custom action position settings

ThoughtSpot users with edit privileges can now define or modify the position of a custom action on visualization pages. When a developer creates a custom action in the Developer portal, ThoughtSpot adds a menu item to the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu by default. ThoughtSpot users can change this to a context menu action or a primary action at any time.

If your application instance requires an action that sends only a single row of data from charts or tables, developers can configure a custom action and restrict it to only the contextual menu. If this setting is enabled on a custom action, ThoughtSpot users cannot modify this action on a visualization page.

For more information, see xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Add a custom action to a specific visualization].

=== Custom link format for ThoughtSpot embedded instances

ThoughtSpot generates links to access objects, such as pinboards, visualizations, and answers, when a user shares an object with another user or follows a pinboard to receive periodic notifications. If you have embedded ThoughtSpot in your application, you might want to generate these links in the format that preserves your host application context.

For embedded instances, ThoughtSpot now allows you to customize the format of these links in the Developer portal. The *Link Settings* page in the Developer portal allows you to customize the link format for various resource URLs and the *unsubscribe* link sent in email notifications.

For more information, see xref:customize-links.adoc[Customize links].

=== REST APIs

The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud June release introduces the following REST API endpoints:

* `POST /tspublic/v1/security/share`

== May 2021
The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud May consists of several new and enhanced features for the  ThoughtSpot Developer users.

=== Custom actions in the context menu
You can now add a custom action to the contextual menu to send data or initiate an action from an embedded visualization. The *Customization* > *Actions* page in the *Develop* tab allows you to add a custom action to the contextual menu for visualizations in the *Answers* or *Pinboards* page.

[NOTE]
This feature is available only if the  link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/new-answer-experience[New Answer experience, window=_blank] is enabled on your ThoughtSpot instance.

For more information, see xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[Add custom actions].

=== Visual Embed SDK 1.2.0
The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud May release introduces the Visual Embed SDK 1.2.0 version with minor updates and backward-compatible improvements.

==== SAML authentication
The Visual Embed SDK packages now include the `noRedirect` attribute as an optional parameter for  the `SSO` `AuthType`. If you want to display the SAML authentication workflow in a pop-up window, instead of refreshing the application web page to direct users to the SAML login page, you can set the `noRedirect` attribute to `true`.

For more information, see the instructions for embedding xref:full-embed.adoc[ThoughtSpot pages], xref:embed-search.adoc[search], xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[pinboard], and xref:embed-a-viz.adoc[visualizations].

==== Visual Embed SDK notification when third-party cookies are disabled
When a user accesses the embedded application from a web browser that has third-party cookies disabled, the Visual Embed SDK emits the `NoCookieAccess` event to notify the developer. Cookies are disabled by default in Safari. Users can enable third-party cookies in Safari’s Preferences setting page or use another web browser.
To know how to enable this setting by default on Safari for a ThoughtSpot embedded instance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

For more information on allowing third-party cookies on Safari, see xref:security-settings.adoc[Browser settings for embedding].
