:page-description: Trusted Authentication


The trusted authentication method is a token-based authentication service, which uses a security token to authenticate ThoughtSpot users who request access to the embedded ThoughtSpot content.

Trusted authentication requires you to have an authenticator server or service, which can securely authenticate the users of the embedding application. __You__ must implement secure authentication within the process that requests the login token from the authenticator server.

The authenticator server has access to a ThoughtSpot secret key, allowing the authenticator server to request a login token __for any user__ on the ThoughtSpot Server. This login token is then sent to the user's web browser, where it is used in the login process.

The following illustration depicts the trusted authentication workflow:

== Key components

The trusted authentication workflow involves several entities, such as the web browser, host application, authenticator server, and the ThoughtSpot application server.

=== Authenticator server

If your organization has an authentication server, you can use it as a trusted authenticator server to authenticate ThoughtSpot users who request access to the embedded ThoughtSpot content.

The authenticator server performs the following functions:

* provide token-based authentication service
* Authenticate users who request access to the embedded content
* Request a token from ThoughtSpot on a user’s behalf
* Return the token to the user's web browser

+
[NOTE]
To use the trusted authentication method, you must add the authentication server domain to the allowed list for CORS. For more information, see xref:security-settings.adoc[Security settings].

=== ThoughtSpot server

For token-based authentication method, ThoughtSpot administrators must  xref:trusted-authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-enable[enable Trusted authentication] in the *Develop* > *Customization* > *Security Settings* page of the ThoughtSpot UI. This setting allows ThoughtSpot administrators to obtain a `secret key`, which is required for requesting access to ThoughtSpot on a user’s behalf.

The trusted authenticator server also uses this secret key to obtain a security token.

=== Security token

The security token, also referred to as the authentication token, allows user to access the requested object.

Note the following points about token validity:

* The token stays valid until another token is generated.
* When a new token is generated using the same secret key, the old token expires after five minutes.
* When you generate a new token using the new secret key, the old token immediately becomes invalid.
* If users make multiple attempts to log in to ThoughtSpot using an invalid or expired token, they may get locked out of their accounts.

== Trusted authentication workflow
The embed user authentication workflow with a trusted authentication service involves the following steps:

. A user logs into the host application and requests access to the embedded ThoughtSpot content.
. The host application sends a request for a user token to the trusted authentication server.
+
To proceed with authentication, the authentication server must determine the following:

 * if the requesting user has authenticated with the server.
 * which user (`username`) is making the request.
 * what is being requested: an object, page, or the entire ThoughtSpot application.
 * whether the requesting `username` matches a `username` added in ThoughtSpot.
. The trusted authenticator service then sends a `POST` request to the `/tspublic/v1/session/login` endpoint. This step creates a session cookie that persists in subsequent API calls.
. After establishing a session, the trusted authentication service sends a POST request to the ThoughtSpot server with the `secret_key` and `username` attributes to obtain an authentication token on the user's behalf.
+
----
POST /tspublic/v1/session/auth/token
----
+
This POST request body includes the following `formData` attributes:

* `secret_key`
+

__String__. The secret key obtained from ThoughtSpot.

* `username`
+
__String__. The `username` of the ThoughtSpot user.

* `access_level`
+
__String__. Mode of access. Valid values are:

** `FULL`
+
Allows access to the entire ThoughtSpot application. When a token has been requested in `FULL` mode, it will create a full ThoughtSpot session in the browser and application. The token for `Full` access mode persists through several sessions and stays valid until another token is generated.


** `REPORT_BOOK_VIEW`
+
Allows access to only one object at a time. The token request for this access mode requires you to specify the GUID of the pinboard or answer. If your application user requires access to another object, a new token request must be sent.

* `id`
+
__String__. The GUID of the pinboard or answer.
This parameter is required only for the `REPORT_BOOK_VIEW` access mode.

. ThoughtSpot verifies the authentication server's request and returns a token.
. The authentication server returns the token to the user's web browser.
+
Note that the following steps are handled automatically if you are using the Visual Embed SDK. For more information, see xref:trusted-authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-sdk[Trusted authentication workflow with Visual Embed SDK].

+
. The client application constructs a fully encoded URL with the authentication token and the embedded resource endpoint and sends it as a query parameter in the GET request to the ThoughtSpot application server.
+
[source, HTML]
----
GET https://<ThoughtSpot-host>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/session/login/token?username=<user>&auth_token=<token>&redirect_url=<full-encoded-url-with-auth-token>
----
The request URL includes the following attributes:


* `username`
+
_String_. The `username` of the user requesting access to the embedded ThoughtSpot content.

* `auth_token`
+
_String_. The authentication token obtained for the user in step 5.

* `redirect_url`
+
_String_. The URL to which the user is redirected after successful authentication. The URL is fully encoded and includes the authentication token obtained for the user.
+
For example, if the user has requested access to a specific visualization on a pinboard, the redirect URL includes the domain to which the user is redirected, the auth token string obtained for the user, visualization ID, and pinboard ID.
+
[source, HTML]
----
https://<redirect-domain>/?authtoken=<user_auth_token>&embedApp=true&primaryNavHidden=true#/embed/viz/<pinboard_id>/<viz-id>
----
[NOTE]
The request URL includes the `auth_token` attribute and the redirect URL uses the `authtoken` attribute.


. ThoughtSpot validates the request and allows access to the requested content.

[#trusted-auth-sdk]
== Trusted authentication workflow with Visual Embed SDK

The Visual Embed SDK simplifies and automates the trusted authentication workflow.

. The SDK checks for an existing user session in the browser.
. If there is no session, it obtains a token either from the specified `authEndpoint` URL, or by using the `getAuthToken` callback method.
. The SDK uses the obtained token and `username` in the GET request to the `/tspublic/v1/session/login/token` endpoint.
. If the request is successful, the SDK renders the embedded content.

For more information, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc[Embed user authentication].

[#trusted-auth-enable]
== Enable trusted authentication
You need ThoughtSpot admin privileges to enable trusted authentication.

. Log in to the ThoughtSpot.
. Click the *Develop* tab.
. Under *Customizations*, click *Settings*.
. To enable trusted authentication, turn on the toggle.
+
A secret key for trusted authentication is generated. This secret key is required for obtaining an authentication token for a ThoughtSpot user.

. Click the clipboard icon to copy the token.
+
The following example shows a ThoughtSpot-generated secret key string.

+
----
b0cb26a0-351e-40b4-9e42-00fa2265d50c
----
This key is required for making API calls to get a token for ThoughtSpot users.

. Store the key in a secure location.
. Click *Save Changes*.


== Disable trusted authentication

To disable trusted authentication, follow these steps:

. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Settings*.
. On the *Settings* page, turn off the *Trusted Authentication* toggle.
+
A pop-up window appears and prompts you to confirm the disable action.

. Click *Disable*.

+
When you disable trusted authentication, the validity of your existing authentication token expires. Your application will become inoperable until you add a new token to it.
To generate a new token, re-enable trusted authentication and obtain the security key.
