:page-description: Embed charts and tables


This page explains how to embed a ThoughtSpot visualization, such as tables and charts, in your Web page, portal, or application.

////
To build this sample, you must have access to a text editor and a ThoughtSpot instance with a visualization.
Experience working with Javascript also helps.
////

== Import the PinboardEmbed package
Import the visualization SDK library to your application environment:

[source,javascript]
----
import { PinboardEmbed, AuthType, init } from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';
----

== Add the embed domain

To allow your client application to connect to ThoughtSpot:

. Configure the URL with ThoughtSpot hostname or IP address.
. Specify the authentication method to use for authenticating application users.
+
[source,javascript]
----
init
    ({
        thoughtSpotHost:"https://<hostname>:<port>",
        authType: AuthType.SSO,
    });
----
+
thoughtSpotHost::
_String_. Hostname or IP address of the ThoughtSpot application.

+
authType::
_String_. Authentication type. You can set the `authType` attribute to one of the following values:

* `*None*`
+
Requires no authentication. The user must already be logged in to ThoughtSpot before interacting with the embedded content.

+
[WARNING]
Do not use this authentication method in production environments.

* `*Basic*`
+
Allows authenticating and logging in a user using the ThoughtSpot `/tspublic/v1/session/login` API. The API request passes `username` and `password` parameters to obtain an authentication token. For more information, see xref:session-api.adoc[Session API].

+
[WARNING]
Do not use this authentication method in production environments.

* `*SSO*`
+
Sets SAML SSO as the authentication method. Federated users can authenticate with their SSO credentials to access the embedded ThoughtSpot content.

** `*noRedirect*` _Optional_
+
_Boolean_. When set to `true`, it opens the SAML SSO authentication workflow in a pop-up window, instead of refreshing the application web page to direct users to the SAML login page. 

+
* `*AuthServer*`

+
+
Enables trusted authentication method. To use the trusted authentication method, specify the  trusted authentication server in the `authEndpoint` attribute or use the `getAuthToken` method. 

+

** `*authEndpoint*` _Optional_
+
_String_. The endpoint URL of the authentication server. When the `authEndPoint` attribute is defined, a GET request is sent to the authentication endpoint, which returns the authentication token as plaintext in its API response. This attribute is not required if `getAuthToken` is used.

** `*username*`
+
_String_. The username of the ThoughtSpot user.

** `*getAuthToken*` _Optional_
+
A function that invokes the trusted authentication endpoint and returns a `Promise` string that resolves to the authentication token. This attribute is not required if `authEndpoint` is used. +

    getAuthToken: () => Promise.resolve(token) 


== Construct the embed content
[source,JavaScript]
----
 const pinboardEmbed = new PinboardEmbed(
    document.getElementById('ts-embed'), 
    {
	  frameParams: {
		width: '100%',
		height: '100%',
	},
	  disabledActions: [],
	  disabledActionReason: '<reason for disabling>',
	  hiddenActions: [],
	  pinboardId: '<%=pinboardGUID%>',
	  vizId: '<%=vizGUID%>',
	  runtimeFilters: [],
    },
});
----
frameParams:: Sets the `width` and `height` dimensions to render the iframe containing the visualization. You can set the `width` and `height` attribute values in pixels or as a percentage. 

disabledActions [small]_optional_::
_Array of strings_. Disables the specified action menu items from the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] on the visualization page.
+

For example, to disable the *Change Title* action from the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], specify the  `EditTitle` action menu string in the `disabledActions` attribute.


+
----
disabledActions: Action.EditTitle
----
+
++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/answer?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it in Playground</a>
++++
+
For a complete list of action menu items and the corresponding strings to use for disabling menu items, see link:{{visualEmbedSDKPrefix}}/enums/action.html[Action, window=_blank].


[NOTE]
If you have xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[added a custom action] and you want to disable this custom action, make sure you specify the ID of the custom action in the `disabledActions` attribute. For example, if a custom action is created with the *Send Email* label and the ID is set as *send-email*, use `send-email` in the `disabledActions` attribute to disable this action on the visualization page.


hiddenActions [small]_optional_::
_Array of strings_. Hides the menu items from the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] on the visualization page.
+

For example, to hide *Download As PDF* action from the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], specify the `DownloadAsPdf` action menu string in the `hiddenActions` attribute.

+
[source,JavaScript]
----
hiddenActions: Action.DownloadAsPdf
----


+
++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/answer?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it in Playground</a>
++++

+
For a complete list of action menu items and the corresponding strings to use for hiding menu items, see link:{{visualEmbedSDKPrefix}}/enums/action.html[Action, window=_blank].


[NOTE]
If you have xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[added a custom action] and you want to hide this custom action, make sure you specify the ID of the custom action in the `hiddenActions` attribute. For example, if a custom action is created with the *Send Email* label and the ID is set as *send-email*, use `send-email` in the `hiddenActions` attribute to hide this action on the  visualization page.


disabledActionReason [small]_optional_::
_String_. Reason for disabling an action on the visualizations page.

vizId::
_String_. The Global Unique Identifier (GUID) of the visualization.

pinboardId::
_String_. The GUID of the pinboard to which the visualization is pinned.
runtimeFilters [small]_optional_::
Runtime filters to be applied when the embedded visualization loads.
+
Runtime filters provide the ability to filter data at the time of retrieval. Runtime filters allow you to apply a filter to a visualization by passing filter specifications in the URL query parameters.
+
For example, to sort values equal to `red` in the `Color` column for a visualization, you can pass the runtime filter in the URL query parameters as shown here:
+
[source,javascript]
----
runtimeFilters: [{
  columnName: 'color',
  operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
  values: [ 'red' ]
  }]
----
For more information, see link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/apply-runtime-filter.html[Apply a Runtime Filter, window=_blank].

+
Runtime filters have several operators you can use to filter your embedded visualizations.

+
[width="50%" cols="1,2,1"]
[options='header']
|===
|Operator|Description|Number of Values

| `EQ`
| equals
| 1

| `NE`
| does not equal
| 1

| `LT`
| less than
| 1

| `LE`
| less than or equal to
| 1

| `GT`
| greater than

| 1

| `CONTAINS`
| contains
| 1

| `BEGINS_WITH`

| 2

| `BW_INC_MIN`
| between inclusive of the lower value
| 2

| `BW_INC`
| between inclusive
| 2

| `BW`
| between non-inclusive

== Render the embedded visualization
Construct the URL for the embedded visualization and render the embedded content:

[source,javaScript]
----
  pinboardEmbed.render();
----


== Subscribe to events
Register event handlers to subscribe to events triggered by the embedded visualizations:

[source,javascript]
----
 pinboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.init, showLoader)
 pinboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.load, hideLoader)
 pinboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.Error)
----

If you have added a xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[custom action], register an event handler to manage the events triggered by the custom action:

[source, javascript]
----
 pinboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.customAction, payload => {
      const data = payload.data;
      if (data.id === 'insert Custom Action ID here') {
          console.log('Custom Action event:', data.columnsAndData);
      }
  })
 
----
For a complete list of event types that you can register, see  link:{{visualEmbedSDKPrefix}}/enums/embedevent.html[EmbedEvent, window=_blank].

== Test the embedded workflow

* Load the client application.
* Try accessing a visualization embedded in your application.
* Verify the rendition.
* If you have disabled a menu item from a visualizations page, verify if the menu command is disabled.
* Verify the runtime filters.

== Code sample

[source,javascript]
----
 import { PinboardEmbed, AuthType, init } from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';
 init({
    	thoughtSpotHost: '<%=tshost%>',
    	authType: AuthType.None,
    });
 const pinboardEmbed = new PinboardEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), 
    {
    	frameParams: {
    		width: '100%',
    		height: '100%',
    	},
    	pinboardId: '6294b4fc-c289-412a-b458-073fcf6e4516',
    	vizId: '28b73b4a-1341-4535-ab71-f76b6fe7bf92',
    },
    });
 pinboardEmbed.render();
