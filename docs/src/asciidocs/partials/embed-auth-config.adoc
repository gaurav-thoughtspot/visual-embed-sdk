authType::  
_String_. Authentication type. You can set the `authType` attribute to one of the following values:

None;;
Requires no authentication. The user must already be logged in to ThoughtSpot before interacting with the embedded content.

+
[WARNING]
Do not use this authentication method in production environments.

Basic;;
Allows authenticating and logging in a user using the ThoughtSpot `/tspublic/v1/session/login` API. The API request passes `username` and `password` parameters to obtain an authentication token. For more information, see xref:session-api.adoc[Session API].

+
[WARNING]
Do not use this authentication method in production environments.

SSO;;
Sets SAML SSO as the authentication method. Federated users can authenticate with their SSO credentials to access the embedded ThoughtSpot content.

+
* `noRedirect` [small]#__Optional__#
+
_Boolean_. When set to `true`, it opens the SAML SSO authentication workflow in a pop-up window, instead of refreshing the application web page to direct users to the SAML login page. 


AuthServer;;
Enables trusted authentication method. To use the trusted authentication method, specify the  trusted authentication server in the `authEndpoint` attribute or use the `getAuthToken` method. 

+
* `authEndpoint` [small]#__Optional__# 
+
_String_. The endpoint URL of the authentication server. When the `authEndPoint` attribute is defined, a GET  request is sent to the authentication endpoint, which returns the authentication token as plain text in its API response. This attribute is not required if `getAuthToken` is used.

* `username`
+
_String_. The username of the ThoughtSpot user.

* `getAuthToken` [small]#__Optional__# 
+
A function that invokes the trusted authentication endpoint and returns a `Promise` string that resolves to the authentication token. This attribute is not required if `authEndpoint` is used. +

    getAuthToken: () => Promise.resolve(token)
