:page-description: Add custom actions

When you embed ThoughtSpot visualizations and pinboards, you can access the menu options that are generally available for all ThoughtSpot instances. You can disable or exclude the menu actions that are not required for your application users. You can also add custom actions that are relevant to your application context.


== Custom actions

You can configure a custom button or menu item to initiate an action in your application from the ThoughtSpot UI and provide the data requested by the user as a payload. You can configure it to invoke a specific URL or a callback into your parent application when a user clicks the custom action. 
////
For example, you may search in ThoughtSpot for customers whose contracts are due for renewal in the next month. You could then trigger an action that brings up a web page from an external billing system. When the billing system is set up to read the data (list of names, emails, products, and renewal dates) from ThoughtSpot, it can add the price, generate an invoice for each customer, and send it by email.

You can add a custom action as a primary button or as a menu command in the **More** menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] on the **Pinboards** and **Search Answers** pages. If the link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/new-answer-experience[New Answer experience, window=_blank] is enabled on your cluster, you can also add a custom action to the contextual menu for visualizations in the **Pinboards** and **Search Answers** page.

== Configure a custom action to send data to a URL
To add custom menu item:

. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Actions*.
. Click *Create action*.
. Add a label for the custom action. For example, Send Survey.
. Select the *URL* option.
. Add the URL that you want to invoke when the user clicks the action label in the UI.

+
If you want to use a URL target for the custom action, make sure the URL is added to the xref:security-settngs.adoc[CORS and CSP whitelist].

. Specify an ID for the custom action.
+
To disable or hide this custom action on a ThoughtSpot page using Visual Embed SDK, use this ID in the `disabledActions` or  `hiddenActions` attribute.

+
For example, if you have a custom action labeled as *Send Survey* and its ID is  *send-survey*, use `send-survey` in the `disabledActions` parameter to disable and in the `hiddenActions` parameter to hide the custom action on a ThoughtSpot application page.

. To specify the position of the custom action button, select one of the following options:
* *Primary*
+
Sets the custom action as a primary button.
* *Menu*
+
Adds the custom action to the  **More** menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu].

* *Context menu*
+
Adds the custom action as a menu item in the contextual menu. The users can access the contextual menu by right-clicking on a visualization. 

+ 
This option is available only if the link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/new-answer-experience[new Answer experience, window=_blank] is enabled on your cluster. 

. Preview  the position of the custom action.

[#callback]
== Configure a callback custom action

ThoughtSpot allows you to programmatically set up a callback function from the parent application which triggers on the click of a custom action. For example, if you want to push insights from ThoughtSpot into your app or trigger an event to an external application, you can add a custom action in Thoughtspot and set up a callback in the parent application. When the user clicks this action on the *Answers* or *Pinboards* page, it initiates a callback to the parent application.

To add a callback custom action:

. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Actions*.
. Click *Create action*.
. Add a label for the custom action.
. Select the *Callback* option.
. Add an ID for the callback function.

+
This ID is used as a reference for the custom action in the Visual Embed SDK. You can use this ID to register a callback event, disable or hide the custom action on a ThoughtSpot application page.

. To specify the position of the custom action button, select one of the following options:
* *Primary*
+
Sets the custom action as a primary button.
* *Menu*
+
Adds the custom action to the  **More** menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu].

* *Context menu*
+
Adds the custom action as a menu item in the contextual menu. The users can access the contextual menu by right-clicking on a visualization. 
+ 
This option is available only if the link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/new-answer-experience[new Answer experience, window=_blank] is enabled on your cluster. 

. Preview  the position of the custom action.
. Select the ThoughtSpot application pages to which you want to add the function.
. Click *Add action*.
. To view the action you just added, click *My actions*.
